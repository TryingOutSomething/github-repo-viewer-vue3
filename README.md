# github-repo-viewer-vue3

## Project Explanation
With the beta release of Vue3, there are plenty of new features available which changes the way we are able to write using VueJS. 

These changes will allow us to write codes that are more manageable compared to vue2, which is great for larger projects with many features.

## Project Description
This app is able to fetch trending repositories *(base on the number of starts or forks)* that are built with VueJS from github.

## Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to demonstrate some features of Vue3, and to experiment what we can do using Composition API. 

It also serves as a starting point for me to find a structure that I am comfortable using the Composition API 
and to familiarise myself with the gitflow workflow design.

Do take a look at the branches for different features and visit the website [here](https://5f3546afd1ccbb70569b5a74--focused-cray-9a652d.netlify.app/).

Currently, the website is not mobile responsive, and the design is very simple. 

This project will be updated once vue 3 is officially released.
